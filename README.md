This application is built using CareKit, an open-source software framework for health apps. This application in particular utilizes a 
HIPAA & GDPR compliant parse-server to store data in the cloud. Carekit is the main package that helps coalesce the CareKitUI and
CareKitStore packages. Features that were implemented by me include using Google to sign in to the app (to aid in protecting user data), 
and creating a map view so you can search and receive directions for various locations that are capable of providing health services.
